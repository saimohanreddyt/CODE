>Boolean type
 .Values are true or false
 . Not an alias for other types (e.g int)
 . Zero value is false


>Numeric type
 . Integer
  . Signed integers
    .int type has varying size , but min 32 bits 
    . 8 bit (int8) througn 64 bit (int64)
  . Unsigned integers
   . 8 bit (bytes and unit*) through 32 bit (unit32)
  . Arithmetic operations
   . Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder
  . Bitwise operations
   . And, or, xor, and not
  . Zero value is 0
  . Can't mix types in same family!(unit16+unit32 = error)
 . Floating point numbers
  . Follow IEEE-754 standard
  . Zero value is 0
  . 32 and 64 bit versions
   . Literal styles
    . Decimal(3.14)
    . Exponential(13e18 or 2E10)
    . Mixed(13.7e12)  
  . Complex numbers
    . Zero values is (0+0i)
    . 64 and 128 bit versions
    . Built-in functions
     . complex - make complex number from two floats
     . real - get real part as float
     . imag - get imaginary part as float

    . Arithmetic operations
      . Additon, subtraction, multiplication, division 

> Text types
 . Strings
   . UTF -8
   .Immutable 
   . Can be concatenated with plus(+) operator
   . Can be converted to []bytes
 . Rune
   . UTF-32
   . Alias for int32
   . Special methods normally required to process
     - e.g. strings,Reader#ReadRune
